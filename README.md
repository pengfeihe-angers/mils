This site is dedicated to the paper "Learning-guided iterated local search for the minmax multiple traveling salesman problem" which was published in Computers & Operations Research. Here, you can find instances, solution certificates, codes, and running rules.  
The binary code "mils" is compiled by G++ 12.2 on the Linux operating system.  
Anyone can run the code by entering ./mils instances/kroa200_3.txt results/kroa200_3_0.txt 10691.0 1000 10000 1. The "instances/kroa200_3.txt" address specifies the benchmark instance, "results/kroa200_3_0.txt" specifies the output file address, "10691.0" specifies the best known results summarized from the literature, "1000" specifies the maximum running time, "10000" specifies the maximum number of iterations, and "1" specifies the random seed.
